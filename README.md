# ![LOGO](logo.png) Receptive **flow**ground Connector

## Description

A generated **flow**ground connector for the Receptive API (version 1.0.0).

Generated from: https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/receptive.io/1.0.0/swagger.json<br/>
Generated at: 2019-05-07T17:43:49+03:00

## API Description

## Who is this for?

This documentation is for developers creating their own integration with [Receptive's](https://www.receptive.io) API. If you are doing a standard integration, there's a really easy [Javascript integration](https://help.receptive.io/hc/en-us/articles/209221969-How-to-integrate-Receptive-with-your-app) that you should know about before you go to the effort of building your own integration.

## Authentication

API calls generally need to be authenticated. Generate an API Key at https://receptive.io/app/#/vendor/settings?section=integrate. This key should then be added to every request URL as a query parameter named 'auth-token'

## Endpoint

API endpoint is https://api.eu-west-1.receptive.io.
## Notes

API endpoints are being added to this documentation as needed by customers. If you don't see an endpoint you need please contact support and if it exists we'll publish the docs here. The 'try it out' feature on this documentation page will probably be blocked by your browser because the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header has its value set by the Receptive server depending on your hostname.

## Generating client code

This documentation is automatically generated from an OpenAPI spec available [here](http://apidoc.receptive.io/receptive.swagger.json). You can use Swagger to auto-generate API client code in many languages using the [Swagger Editor](http://editor.swagger.io/#/)

### Ping to create or update an EndUser and Account in one call

> Replicates much of the functionality of the widget ping, allowing callers to create or update User records for End Users. If you call this with a new User and/or Account, the record will be created. If you call for an existing User/Account, the record will be updated. You can also call this at EndUser login time, or more frequently, to notify Receptive that the EndUser has been seen. This keeps Receptive's 'last seen' data fresh and updates your reporting. This endpoint is used by our Zapier integration. The only value allowed in user.roles is 'endUser'. The id you supply here for the User and Account should be your own unique id, which Receptive calls external_id. This probably isn't the same as Receptive's id seen elsewhere in the API.

*Tags:* `user`

### Invite an EndUser (customer)

*Tags:* `user`

### Invite a VendorUser (Team member)

*Tags:* `user` `team`

### Find a User with a query

* `email` - _optional_ - Find user by their email address. Role param must be specified when using this option
* `role` - _optional_ - Users role ('vendorUser' or 'endUser'). Only useful when finding a user by their email address
    Possible values: endUser, vendorUser.

### Delete a User
